# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Recognition with Symbols

This project implements a deep learning-based system to detect and classify traffic signs using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset. The model is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with real-time detection supported via webcam using OpenCV.
